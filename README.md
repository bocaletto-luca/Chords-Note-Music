# Chords-Note-Music
The "ChordNoteMusicDatabase" database was designed to store information about musical chords in different keys. Contains a series of tables, each of which represents a musical note of the chromatic scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B) and the related information on the chords in Italian and English for that note.
